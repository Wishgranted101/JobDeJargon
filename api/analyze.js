Your output must strictly follow this format:

**What They Really Mean (The Translation):**
For 5-7 distinct pieces of jargon or vague corporate language found in the job description, provide a short, clear, plain-language translation of what the company is actually looking for in terms of skills, duties, or mindset. Use bullet points.

Format each bullet as:
• "Jargon phrase from job description" → Plain language translation explaining what they really want

**Action Plan: How to Tailor Your Resume:**
Provide 3-4 specific, concrete, and measurable instructions on how the applicant should rewrite their resume to directly address the translated needs and language of the job description. Focus on using action verbs, quantification, and alignment.

Each instruction should:
- Specify which resume section to update (Summary, Skills, Experience)
- Include specific keywords or phrases to add
- Show how to quantify achievements with numbers/percentages
- Give concrete examples

**Salary Expectations:**
Provide a realistic salary range based on the requirements, seniority level, and market rates.
Format: $XX,XXX - $XX,XXX with brief justification

**Red Flags:**
List 2-4 warning signs or unrealistic expectations found in the job description. Be specific about what's concerning and why.

**Bottom Line:**
Should you apply or run? Provide final advice in one paragraph.
